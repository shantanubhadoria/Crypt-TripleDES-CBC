NAME

    Crypt::TripleDES::CBC - Triple DES in CBC mode Pure implementation

VERSION

    version 0.006

SYNOPSIS

       use Crypt::TripleDES::CBC;
     
       my $key = pack("H*"
         , "1234567890123456"
         . "7890123456789012");
       my $iv = pack("H*","0000000000000000");
       my $crypt = Crypt::TripleDES::CBC->new(
         key => $key,
         iv  => $iv,
       );
     
       say unpack("H*",$crypt->encrypt(pack("H*","0ABC0F2241535345631FCE")));            # Output F64F2268BF6185A16DADEFD7378E5CE5
       say unpack("H*",$crypt->decrypt(pack("H*","F64F2268BF6185A16DADEFD7378E5CE5")));  # Output 0ABC0F2241535345631FCE0000000000

DESCRIPTION

    Most Modules on CPAN don't do a standards compliant implementation,
    while they are able to decrypt what they encrypt. There are corner
    cases where certain blocks of data in a chain don't decrypt properly.
    This is (almost)a pure perl implementation of TripleDES in CBC mode
    using Crypt::DES to encrypt individual blocks.

ATTRIBUTES

 cipher1

    First Crypt::DES Cipher object generated from the key. This is built
    automatically. Do not change this value from your program.

 cipher2

    second Crypt::DES Cipher object generated from the key. This is built
    automatically. Do not change this value from your program.

 key

    Encryption Key this must be ascii packed string as shown in Synopsis.

 iv

    Initialization vector, default is a null string.

METHODS

 encrypt

    Encryption Method

 decrypt

    Decryption method
